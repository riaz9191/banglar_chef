          Question 1 : Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and
          controlled components.
        </h1>
        <p>
          <strong> Answer: </strong>
          Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and controlled
          components. Uncontrolled components are components that store their
          own state internally, rather than being controlled by React.
          Controlled components are controlled by React.The main difference
          between these two approaches is that in a controlled component, the
          state of the input is managed by React, while in an uncontrolled
          component, it is managed by the DOM.
